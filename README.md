# Team Fortress Competitive League Configs

Hi! These are the configs for TFCL, otherwise known as the Team Fortress Competitive League, a competitive Team Fortress 2 league. These configs were created from scratch, though the UGC and ETF2L configs must be mentioned as precursors. 

I tried my best to remove extraneous commands while minimizing the ability for cheating or exploitation or unfair play with preexisting server settings. If you find that I missed something, or if something doesn't work the way it should, or you have a suggestion, *please add and message me on Steam or Twitter*. 

my steam id is / thesqrtminus1 / and my twitter is @ thesqrtminus1 .

There are different configs for scrims and matches. ***

## !!Read this section if you're not going to read anything else!!

Here are the configs you need to exec for specific modes/map types.

**6s:**

5cp Match: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_6s_match` < exec for 5cp matches >
* 5cp Match Overtime: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_6s_OT` < exec for overtime in matches >
* 5cp Match Golden Cap: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_6s_GOLD` < exec for golden cap in matches

5cp Scrim: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_6s_scrim` *exec for 5cp scrims*
KoTH (Match/Scrim): `(rcon) exec tfcl_koth_6s` *exec for any koth maps*
Stopwatch (Match/Scrim): `(rcon) exec tfcl_stopwatch_6s` *exec for any stopwatch style maps*


**HL:**

5cp Match: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_HL_match` < exec for 5cp matches >
* 5cp Match Overtime: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_HL_OT` < exec for overtime in matches >
* 5cp Match Golden Cap: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_HL_GOLD` < exec for golden cap in matches

5cp Scrim: `(rcon) exec tfcl_5cp_HL_scrim` *exec for 5cp scrims*
KoTH (Match/Scrim): `(rcon) exec tfcl_koth_HL` *exec for any koth maps*
Stopwatch (Match/Scrim): `(rcon) exec tfcl_stopwatch_HL` *exec for any stopwatch style maps*

**Ultiduo:**

`(rcon) exec tfcl_ultiduo_UD`


These are still being updated, please be patient while I add missing modes.

These are for use in the relaunch of TFCL. *Do not use them for TFCL matches until they are live on the tfcleague domain.*


Todo: 

* ~~add golden cap for all modes~~ **done**
* ~~add stopwatch~~ **done**
* ~~add ?ctf?~~ **probably will never happen**
* ~~add ultiduo~~ **done**
* ~~add highlander~~ **done**
