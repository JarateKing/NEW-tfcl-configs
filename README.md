## Team Fortress Competitive League Configs

Hi! These are the configs for TFCL, otherwise known as the Team Fortress Competitive League, a competitive Team Fortress 2 league. These configs were created from scratch, though the UGC and ETF2L configs must be mentioned as precursors. 

I tried my best to remove extraneous commands while minimizing the ability for cheating or exploitation or unfair play with preexisting server settings. If you find that I missed something, or if something doesn't work the way it should, or you have a suggestion, *please add and message me on Steam or Twitter*. 

my steam id is / thesqrtminus1 / and my twitter is @ thesqrtminus1 .

To use these, exec tfcl_\<gamemode\>.cfg and it'll do the rest. 

These are still being updated, please be patient while I add missing modes.

These are for use in the relaunch of TFCL. *Do not use them for TFCL matches until they are live on the tfcleague domain.*


Todo: 

* ~~add golden cap for all modes~~ **done**
* ~~add stopwatch~~ **done**
* ~~add ?ctf?~~ **probably will never happen**
* ~~add ultiduo~~ **done**
* ~~add highlander~~ **done**
